"""This file contains some supporting utility functions for the `earthquakes.py` script.

In general, if you are finding that you need to split up your scripts into multiple files
because they're too long, or they use the same individual "pieces" of code, you would
consider writing a package containing the common functionality.
We will see how to do this later in the course (and in the assignment)!.

Since this repository is fairly small, we'll just use a couple of auxiliary files - like
this one - to store our 'helper' functions.
This is mainly so tha the `earthquakes.py` file only contains code that's actually
relevant to what we want to do in the exercises / homework / pre-reading.

This file contains the functionality to have the earthquake data be saved to the local
machine, and also outlines the structure of the data so Python can give typehints.

# What follows below is some type-hint setup for interpreting the data.
# The data that we fetch comes in JSON format, which means that Python will
# represent it as a sequence of (possibly nested) dictionaries and lists.
#
# We can optionally choose to inform the Python type-hinter of the data
# structure ahead of time, which can be handy for you when you're writing
# your analysis!
# This is what we're doing below.
# Don't forget that the general structure of the data that we get back from
# the US Geological Survey site has the format:
# {
#   "type": text noting the type of query we sent to the website,
#   "metadata": dictionary of metadata information,
#   "features": list of earthquake objects - each earthquake is a dictionary,
#   "bbox": list of floats defining the bounding box of the earthquake locations
# }
#
# Since the data uses a fixed set of keys, we can use the `TypedDict` class to
# create our type-hints. The `TypedDict` class allows us to create a type-hint
# to tell Python we expect to find a dictionary with a fixed set of keys, which
# tools like VSCode can pick up on to help us write our Python code.
# `TypedDict` is not actually used when we _run_ our Python code, it is just
# scanned by the Python type-hinter to resolve argument types and values!
